# You are given two arrays a[] and b[], return the Union of both the arrays in any order.

# The Union of two arrays is a collection of all distinct elements present in either of the arrays.
# If an element appears more than once in one or both arrays, it should be included only once in the result.

# Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct.
# Note that, You can return the Union in any order but the driver code will print the result in sorted order only.

        return list(set(a).union(set(b)))
