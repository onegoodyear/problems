# Given two arrays a[] and b[] of equal size, the task is to find whether the elements in the arrays are equal.
# Two arrays are said to be equal if both contain the same set of elements, arrangements (or permutations) of elements may be different though.
# Note: If there are repetitions, then counts of repeated elements must also be the same for two arrays to be equal.



class Solution:
    def checkEqual(self, a, b) -> bool:
        d = {}
        for val in a:
            if val in d: d[val] += 1
            else: d[val] = 1
            
        for val in b:
            if val in d: d[val] -= 1
            else: return False
            
        for key in d:
            if d[key]!=0: return False
        
        return True
